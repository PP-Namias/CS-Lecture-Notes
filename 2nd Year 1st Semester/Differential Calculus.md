# DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
The word __CALCULUS__ was derived from the Latin word _“__calculi__”_ which means pebble or small stone. It is a branch of mathematics concerned with a rate of change of one variable quantity with respect to another, the calculations of varying speeds and motions and slope of a complex curve.

The development of Calculus was credited to __Isaac Newton [ 1643 - 1727 ]__, an English Mathematician, physicist, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and economics. And, __Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz [ 1646 - 1714 ]__ a German mathematician, scientist, philosopher and diplomat.

## Common Branches of Calculus
1. __Differential Calculus__
2. __Integral Calculus__
3. __Differential Equations__

## __DIFFERENTIATION__
### Increment of a Function
A very small change in the value of the variables. An increment of X is denoted by “$∆X$” and is read as __Delta-X__.

### Ratio of Increments
A very small change in the value of dependent variable “$y$” over the very small change in the value of the independent variable “$x$”, in symbol $∆y/∆x$

## General Rule of Differentiation
  __(The 4-Step Rule)__
1. Replace y by “$y + ∆y$” and $x$ by “ + $∆x$”.
    - $y = f(x)$
    - $y+ ∆y = f(x + ∆x)$
2. Subtract y from the function of $x$
    - $∆y = f(x + ∆x) – y$
    - $∆y = f(x + ∆x) – f(x)$
3. Form the ratio if the increment by dividing $∆x$ to both sides of the equation
    - $∆y  = f(x+∆x) – f(x)$
    - $∆x ∆x$
4. Apply limit to the ratio of increments as $∆x$ approaches zero. In symbol
    - $Limit ∆x→0  ∆y/∆x$
    - 
    - $Lim.      ∆y = Lim.    f(x+∆x) – f(x)$
    - ∆x>0       ∆x     ∆x>0            ∆x
    - $dy\over dx$ (read as derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.)
    - $dx$

## Differentiate the following by 4-Step Rule:


When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
