# What Is HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)? Meaning, Importance, Examples, and Goals
Human-computer interaction (HCI) targets the design and implementation of interactive technology.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is defined as the field of study that focuses on optimizing how users and computers interact by designing interactive computer interfaces that satisfy users’ needs. This article explains the fundamentals of HCI, its goals, importance, and examples.

## What Is HCI?
Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the field of study that focuses on optimizing how users and computers interact by designing interactive computer interfaces that satisfy users’ needs. It is a multidisciplinary subject covering computer science, behavioral sciences, cognitive science, ergonomics, psychology, and design principles.

The emergence of HCI dates back to the 1980s, when personal computing was on the rise. It was when desktop computers started appearing in households and corporate offices. HCI’s journey began with video games, word processors, and numerical units.

However, with the advent of the internet and the explosion of mobile and diversified technologies such as voice-based and Internet of Things (IoT), computing became omnipresent and omnipotent. Technological competence further led to the evolution of user interactions. Consequently, the need for developing a tool that would make such man-machine interactions more human-like grew significantly. This established HCI as a technology, bringing different fields such as cognitive engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and others under its realm.

Today, HCI focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating interactive interfaces that enhance user experience using computing devices. This includes user interface design, user-centered design, and user experience design.

## Key components of HCI
Fundamentally, HCI is made up of four key components:

1. __The user__

    The user component refers to an individual or a group of individuals that participate in a common task. HCI studies users’ needs, goals, and interaction patterns. It analyzes various parameters such as users’ cognitive capabilities, emotions, and experiences to provide them with a seamless experience while interacting with computing systems.

2. __The goal-oriented task__

    A user operates a computer system with an objective or goal in mind. The computer provides a digital representation of objects to accomplish this goal. For example, booking an airline for a destination could be a task for an aviation website. In such goal-oriented scenarios, one should consider the following aspects for a better user experience:

     - The complexity of the task that the user intends to accomplish

    - Knowledge and skills necessary to interact with the digital object
    - Time required to carry out the task

3. __The interface__

    The interface is a crucial HCI component that can enhance the overall user interaction experience. Various interface-related aspects must be considered, such as interaction type (touch, click, gesture, or voice), screen resolution, display size, or even color contrast. Users can adjust these depending on the user’s needs and requirements.

    For example, consider a user visiting a website on a smartphone. In such a case, the mobile version of the website should only display important information that allows the user to navigate through the site easily. Moreover, the text size should be appropriately adjusted so that the user is in a position to read it on the mobile device. Such design optimization boosts user experience as it makes them feel comfortable while accessing the site on a mobile phone.

4. __The context__

    HCI is not only about providing better communication between users and computers but also about factoring in the context and environment in which the system is accessed. For example, while designing a smartphone app, designers need to evaluate how the app will visually appear in different lighting conditions (during day or night) or how it will perform when there is a poor network connection. Such aspects can have a significant impact on the end-user experience.

Thus, HCI is a result of continuous testing and refinement of interface designs that can affect the context of use for the users.

## Examples of HCI
  1. __IoT technology__
  2. __Eye-tracking technology__
  3. __Speech recognition technology__
  4. __AR/VR technology__
  5. __Cloud computing__

## Goals of HCI
The principal objective of HCI is to develop functional systems that are usable, safe, and efficient for end-users. The developer community can achieve this goal by fulfilling the following criteria:

Have sound knowledge of how users use computing systems
Design methods, techniques, and tools that allow users to access systems based on their needs
Adjust, test, refine, validate, and ensure that users achieve effective communication or interaction with the systems
Always give priority to end-users and lay the robust foundation of HCI

To realize the above points, developers must focus on two relevant areas: usability and user experience. Let’s look at each category in detail:

1. __Usability__
    
    Usability is key to HCI as it ensures that users of all types can quickly learn and use computing systems. A practical and usable HCI system has the following characteristics:

    - __How to use it__: This should be easy to learn and remember for new and infrequent users to learn and remember. For example, operating systems with a user-friendly interface are easier to understand than DOS operating systems that use a command-line interface.
    - __Safe__: A safe system safeguards users from undesirable and dangerous situations. This may refer to users making mistakes and errors while using the system that may lead to severe consequences. Users can resolve this through HCI practices. For example, systems can be designed to prevent users from activating specific keys or buttons accidentally. Another example could be to provide recovery plans once the user commits mistakes. This may give users the confidence to explore the system or interface further.
    - __Efficient__: An efficient system defines how good the system is and whether it accomplishes the tasks that it is supposed to. Moreover, it illustrates how the system provides the necessary support to users to complete their tasks.
    - __Effective__: A practical system provides high-quality performance. It describes whether the system can achieve the desired goals.
    - __Utility__: Utility refers to the various functionalities and tools provided by the system to complete the intended task. For example, a sound utility system offers an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides intermittent help to programmers or users through suggestions.
    - __Enjoyable__: Users find the computing system enjoyable to use when the interface is less complex to interpret and understand.

2. __User experience__

    User experience is a subjective trait that focuses on how users feel about the computing system when interacting with it. Here, user feelings are studied individually so that developers and support teams can target particular users to evoke positive feelings while using the system.

    HCI systems classify user interaction patterns into the following categories and further refine the system based on the detected pattern:

    - Desirable traits – satisfying, enjoyable, motivating, or surprising
    - Undesirable traits – Frustrating, unpleasant, or annoying
